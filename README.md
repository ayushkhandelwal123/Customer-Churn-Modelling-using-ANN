## Customer-Churn-Modelling-using-ANN

In this project about customer churn modelling using Artificial Neural Networks, we are trying to predict whether the customer stays in the bank or leave the bank using a very popular deep learning library **Tensorflow**.

### Independent Features considered for the prediction :
- CreditScore
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- NumOfProducts
- HasCrCard
- IsActiveMember
- EstimatedSalary

The dependent variable we are trying to predict is **Exited** which implies whether or not customer stayed in the bank.
Here, 0 means that the customer stayed in the bank and 1 implies that the customer leaves the bank.
